**Analysis of Major Tech Companies' Employment and Performance in the Aftermath of COVID and Rise of AI**

## Overview
This project presents an interactive Tableau dashboard and analytical report exploring the evolving relationship between employment dynamics, especially H-1B visa trends and stock performance across major tech companies, post-COVID and during the rise of artificial intelligence.

We focus on:
- H-1B visa approvals/denials (2023–2024)
- Stock price fluctuations and trends
- Tech layoffs and workforce dynamics
- Company-specific insights (e.g., Meta Platforms Inc.)

## 📈 Dashboards

### 🔹 Layoff Dashboard
Visualizes the connection between tech company layoffs and stock valuation to understand investor confidence during workforce changes.

### 🔹 Visa Effect Dashboard
Displays H-1B visa approval and denial trends for major tech firms like Apple, Google, Meta, Microsoft, Netflix, NVIDIA, and Salesforce. It correlates visa outcomes with headcount and stock performance.

### 🔹 Meta Journal Dashboard
A focused case study on Meta examining how stock performance aligns with H-1B decisions, layoffs, and workforce fluctuations. Offers deeper insight into how immigration policy impacts valuation and talent strategies.
